# Frontend Best Practices for React with Context API Entertainment App

## Project Structure

- **Organize Components**: Keep your components organized in a logical directory structure.

- **Reusable Components**: Create reusable components to avoid code duplication.

## State Management

- **Context API**: Use Context API for global state management. Create separate context files for different concerns (e.g., AuthContext, MediaContext).
- **Provider Components**: Wrap your application with provider components at the highest level possible (usually in `index.js`).

## API Calls

- **Axios**: Use Axios for making API calls. Create a separate file (e.g., `api.js`) for configuring Axios and managing API calls.
- **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling in your API calls to display user-friendly messages.

## Performance Optimization

- **Code Splitting**: Use React's lazy loading and Suspense to split your code into smaller chunks and load components on demand.

## UI/UX

- **Responsive Design**: Ensure your app is responsive and works well on different screen sizes using CSS Grid or Flex-box.
- **Loading States**: Display loading indicators while fetching data from the API.

## Best Practices

- **Descriptive Naming**: Use descriptive names for components, variables, and functions.
- **Prop Types**: Use PropTypes or TypeScript to define component props and ensure type safety.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure your app is accessible to users with disabilities by following ARIA guidelines and using semantic HTML.
